# General

As what the name said, this is a set of metrics that describe overall information from the document. 

This is important for people for assignment that have specific length or language, etc. 

This metrics exist because it would be a great help for the teacher to see the overall statistics on the document, as well as how it performs compared to the average submission on the course. 

List of general information metrics that will be used:  
1. Language
2. Sentences
3. Average sentence length
4. Words
5. Average word length
6. Unique words
7. Characters
8. Lexical diversity
9. Part of Speech percentage

[//]: # (TODO: Describe them one by one, maybe focus on the lexical diversity part, which might cause the most confusion)

## Language
It determines the language of the content. We use Google Translate API to take the first sentence of the text and detect its language.  

## Lexical Diversity
A measure of how many different words that are used in the text. It refers to the ratio of different unique word stems to the total number of words.

## Part of Speech
A category of words that have similar grammatical properties. Part of speeches that are possible to be omitted in this program are listed in https://universaldependencies.org/docs/u/pos/.
