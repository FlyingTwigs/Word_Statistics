# General

As what the name said, this is a set of metrics that describe overall information from the document. 

This is important for people for assignment that have specific length or language, etc. 

This metrics exist because it would be a great help for the teacher to see the overall statistics on the document, as well as how it performs compared to the average submission on the course. 

List of general information metrics that will be used:  
1. Language
2. Sentences
3. Average sentence length
4. Words
5. Average word length
6. Unique words
7. Characters
8. Lexical diversity
9. Part of Speech percentage
