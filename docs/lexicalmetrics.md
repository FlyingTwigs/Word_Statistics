# Lexical

[//]: # (TODO: Fill this out with details on each metrics because apparently it is hard to describe)

Lexical sophistication refers to percentage of advanced words in a text. 

The metrics is extracted from BNC (British National Corpus) and MRC Psycholinguistic Database.

From [BNC](https://www.english-corpora.org/bnc/), we use the corpus advanced metrics such as word frequency and word range. BNC is a "100 million-word collection of samples of written and spoken language from a wide range of sources".

From [MRC Psycholinguistic database](https://websites.psychology.uwa.edu.au/school/MRCDatabase/uwa_mrc.htm), we use familiarity, concreteness, imagery and meaningfulness of words that are extracted from the text.

All of the output score for metrics below are based on the averate reference corpus score (except for Age of Acquisition, which come from ratings collected from [this paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-016-0811-4))

Metrics that are used in the project
1. Word Frequency
2. Word Range
3. Familiarity
4. Concreteness
5. Imageability
6. Age of Acquisition
7. Meaningfulness 

## Word Frequency
List of words that are most encountered in daily life. The higher the score is, the more frequent it is. 

Function words that are used in Word Frequency Function are words that contribute to the syntax of a sentence as opposed to its meaning, such as pronouns, prepositions, auxiliary verbs, articles, conjunctions.

In contrast to function words, content words are words that primarily express lexical meaning and thus contribute to overall meaning of the sentence. Usually, it consists of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.

## Word Range
A measure on how wide a word will be used. It could also be said that word range is calculated as a count of the number of documents in which a word occurs.


## Familiarity
A measure on how familiar a certain word is to an adult. 

## Concreteness
A measure on how abstract a word is. The more highly abstract in meaning a word, the lower the concreteness score will be.
Words such as "window" will have higher concreteness score, while word "because" will have lower concreteness score.

## Imageability
A measure on how easy is it to create an image from a word. Words such as beach will have higher imageability score, while word "plenipotentiary" will have lower imageability score.

## Age of Acquisition
A measure on the age at which a word is thought to have been learned. The number represented is reflected from the age or education level of the reader. 

## Meaningfulness 
A measure on how related a word is to other words.
